1. Restricted and unrestricted decision trees
# Build restricted decision tree
clf = DecisionTreeClassifier(min_samples_leaf=3, min_samples_split=9, random_state=500, max_depth=4, max_features=2)
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict the labels
pred = clf.predict(X_test)

# Print the confusion matrix
cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, pred)
print('Confusion matrix:\n', cm)

# Print the F1 score
score = f1_score(y_test, pred)
print('F1-Score: {:.3f}'.format(score))

2. "Weak" decision tree
Answer: Model A is fine-tuned while model B is "weak".
